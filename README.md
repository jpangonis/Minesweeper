This is a redone version of minesweeper. There are 3 difficulty levels and each level changes the grid size and mine count. 
Try to find where all the mines are as fast as you can! Once you think you found a mind, right click to flag it. 
Press the smiley face to restart the game. 
The numbers in each grid show how many neighboring mines there are. 
Neighbors are defined as N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, E, W.
